# Hello, I'm Kamil Dolezal! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ“ I'm a Junior Java Developer passionate about learning and exploring the world of software development.

ðŸ’» Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on improving my skills in:
- **Java SE** (Java Standard Edition)
- **Spring Framework**
- **Maven**
- **JUnit** for testing
- **MySQL** and **H2** databases

ðŸ”­ I'm working on:
- Building small Java console applications that focus on learning fundamental principles like OOP, collections and file I/O.
- Experimenting with Spring Boot to develop simple web applications with REST APIs.

ðŸŒ± My next goal is:
- Improve myself in designing of REST API.
